        "We will use the example of a recommender system, i.e., a system which must recommend movies of interests to its users (e.g., Netflix). We will model user-movie preferences from a popular publicly available dataset (Movielens 1M). We will learn, from past user-movie ratings, to predict (missing/future) user-movie ratings from user socio-demographics and movie-tags data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematically, we are interested in learning the (parameters of the) following function:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ r_{um} = f_\\theta(x_u, x_m)$$\n",
        "where\n",
        "- $u$ indexes users\n",
        "- $m$ indexes items\n",
        "- $r_{um}$ is u's rating for m (that user's preference) -- the dependent variable\n",
        "- $f_\\theta$ is some model parametrized by $\\theta$. For example, a linear regression with coefficients $\\theta$\n",
        "- $x_u$ are user u's covariates (e.g., age and occupation of this user)\n",
        "- $x_m$ are movie m's covariates (e.g., tags associated with the movie)\n",
        "\n",
        "The function $f$ can take several forms (in other words, we can use a variety of models for this task). In today's tutorial we will assume that the problem is a regression one and we will experiment with several models ranging from a simple linear regression model to a more complicated two-hidden layer neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Machine Learning terminology\n",
        "\n",
        "It can be useful to think of machine learning as comprising three elements:\n",
        "1. Task (T)\n",
        "2. Experience (E)\n",
        "3. Performance measure (P).\n",
        "\n",
        "(a good description of these concepts is provided in [Ch. 5 of the Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/ml.html))\n",
        "\n",
        "The intuition is that the task (T) is \"the type of problem you are trying the solve\" (e.g., classification, regression, anomaly detection), the experience (E) is \"how your data comes about\" (e.g., does it come with labels or not, do you observe it all at once or as a stream), and the performance (P) is \"how well your model does\". Standard performance measures include accuracy and mean-squared error.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the above terminology does not define the model used to learn (fit) the data nor does it define the fitting procedure (e.g., gradient descent).\n",
        "\n",
        "Relationship to the problem of rating prediction:\n",
        "- Task: Our task is to predict user-movie ratings. It can be modelled in different ways (more on this during week 11), but here we will model it as a regression problem.\n",
        "- Experience: The experience is a supervised learning one because we are predicting some dependent variable (rating) from a set of independent variables\n",
        "- Performance measure: We will be using the mean-squared error (MSE).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Setting up the data\n",
        "\n",
        "For supervised learning, it is customary, to construct two data matrix $X$ and $Y$. The former, $X$, contains the covariates (features). It is a matrix of size $n \\times p$ with $n$ the number of examples and $p$ the dimensionality of each example (in other words the number of covariates associated with each example).  They are the input to the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$X = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
        "x_{11} & x_{12} & \\ldots & x_{1p} \\\\\n",
        "\\vdots & \\vdots       &  \\ddots      & \\vdots \\\\\n",
        "x_{n1} & x_{12} & \\ldots & x_{np} \\\\\n",
        "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The latter, $Y$, is a (column) vector of length $n$ which contains the labels (here ratings). $Y_1$ corresponds to the rating of $X_1$ (row  contains the labels (here ratings).\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "Y = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
        "r_1 \\\\\n",
        "r_2 \\\\\n",
        "\\vdots \\\\\n",
        "r_n\n",
        "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, in a real problem we will differentiate the `train` and `test` sets, e.g., with $X_\\text{train}$ and $X_\\text{test}$. Same for the labels using, e.g., $Y_\\text{train}$ and $Y_\\text{test}$."

For example, here each tag has a numerical index (e.g., tag `scary` is id `882`) but tags cannot be compared using their numbers (e.g., tag `882` is not \"bigger\" than tag `880` or smaller than tag `900`). 1-of-K encoding deals with this by encoding each tag as a binary vector of length $K$ with a single non-zero value which corresponds to the tag. In the present case, $K=968$ tags, and tag `scary` would have a `1` at position `882`.\n",

In such cases you will likely need to split a separate validation set from your training data--in `sklearn` you can use the `train_test_split` function. It is typical for the validation set to be the same size as the test set.\n",

        "You should also remember to **never select model hyperparameters based on performance on test set**, this would give you over-optimistic results because you are effectively using your test set to tune your models (its hyperparameters). The main purpose of the test set is to provide an unbiased way of comparing different models.\n",

This is intuitive, the more data you have about an item the more accurate should be the estimation of its parameters ($\\theta_{\\text{mid}}$). This could also be reinforced by the fact that we are splitting ratings randomly for train and test (versus splitting by user or item). Hence, popular movies and high-activity users have a great influence in the learning process."

So the tags do seem to provide slightly better test performance at the expense of a slightly larger model (968 extra parameters to fit) which takes about 30% longer to fit. Take this with a grain of salt because it is hardware dependent. But, this hints at the fact that the fitting algorithm is not linear (i.e., increasing the number of parameters by 10% yields an increase of 30% in running time).\n",

        "- In addition, we use a second regularizer called `early-stopping`. Learning the parameters of a neural network is done iteratively using a method called gradient descent (as opposed to linear regression, there is no analytical solution for the parameters given the objective function). Early stopping simply evaluates the validation error after each iteration. It stops learning when the validation error stops improving. This can happen before the training loss converges. When it does not, then this regularizer has no effect on learning. In `scikit-learn`, the MLPRegressor class with `early_stopping=True` automatically splits a validation set from the training set to be used by this regularizer. The disadvantage, of course, is that this reduces the amount of data used to fit parameters."

We will spend one full week (week #11) thinking about preference data including where it's coming from and how to model it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few more parting thoughts:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Machine Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "As you might have noticed, applied machine learning is a very empirical endeavour. Once you have data in the right format, it is typical to fit it using several models, each time trying to understand the advantages/disadvantages of each model and getting a more thorough understanding of the data. In practice, this last part may be crucial and we did not adress it much in this tutorial (instead focussing on the models themeselves).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Scikit-learn\n",
        "`scikit-learn` is a powerful ML library. It is meant as a model (and data pre-processing) toolbox. It provides an interface to a wide variety of models, it is actively developped, and in general seen as a very good plateform. It is also open source and free to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model Selection, i.e., which model should I use for a particular dataset/task can be daunting. [This page](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html) provides some tips particular to `scikit-learn`. In general, when working on a new task/dataset it is often useful to try and compare different models. Remember that in practice (mean) test-performance is only one of the possible desiderata (others include running time both for training and other metrics like false positive rates).\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that `scikit-learn` does not fit every use case. For example, its support of modern neural networks is fairly modest. It is also not meant as a development plateform for new models.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Other packages\n",
        "\n",
        "Software is one of the reasons behind the rise of modern machine learning. Modern software automatize a number of tasks which allow programmers and researchers alike to be much more efficient. `scikit-learn` is one popular package for fitting machine learning models but there exist others (both applied and also for exploration/development purposes). All in all, it can be useful to know about these packages but (in my opinion) it is more useful to have a good understanding of the fundamentals of the field as the package landscape changes rapidly and one can always learn one more.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Food for thought\n",
        " - In our models we assumed that ratings were the dependent variable (y) and that we had covariates (e.g., features of users and movies). Imagine a setting where we don't have any features or, somewhat equivalently, only have features that end up not being predictive of ratings. In that case the linear regression model would be:\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Question 7:** What's wrong with the above model? Try to think about it for a minute or two before looking at the answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- As we will see during week 11 (on recommender systems), many models take ratings as output **and** as input. For example, one could take a user's previous ratings and try to predict one's future ratings (for example using an auto-encoder model). This is a nice way to build models that do not require any user/item covariates (and these models can also be extended when that data exist)."
